import AppliftersOnly from '@/components/AppliftersOnly.astro'

It's suggested to use [Tanstack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) instead of [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)  

<AppliftersOnly />

To summarize why we think Tanstack Router is superior:

- Better typesafety (path params, search params, route definitions)
- Awesome integration with [Tanstack Query](./data-fetching/tanstack-query-overview/)
- Tanstack ecosystem - we already have a very pleasant experience with other Tanstack tools (query, table, virtual) and if we decide in the future that we want to build SSR apps with [Tanstack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) it will be very familiar experience since it's mostly a wrapper around Tanstack Router.

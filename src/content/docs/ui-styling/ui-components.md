The recommended approach for creating reusable UI components is [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Most components are based on [Radix UI Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives), with default styling using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style/docs).

## Typography

Shadcn/ui does not have a dedicated typography component. A recommended approach is described in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/363#issuecomment-1659259897), which has been tested on multiple projects with good results.

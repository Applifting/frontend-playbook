## What we care about

- **Readable, self-explanatory code** instead of clever tricks.
- **Single responsibility & separation of concerns** for functions, components,
  hooks, and features.
- **Typed and immutable by default** — no `any`, careful enums, and safe
  constants.
- **Declarative, side-effect aware React** with pure functions, clear data
  flow, and proper error handling.
- **Consistent project structure** so moving between codebases feels familiar.

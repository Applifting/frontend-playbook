import AppliftersOnly from '@/components/AppliftersOnly.astro'

The go-to solution is [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) with [zod](https://zod.dev/) validation and [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) form components. [See the example in their docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form).

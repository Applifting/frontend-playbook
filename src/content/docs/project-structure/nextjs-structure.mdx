import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

All information mentioned in [Pages & Routes (Common Concepts)](../pages-routes) applies.

- **App Router (Preferred)**  
  Use the `app/` directory for routing in new projects. Each route file under `app/` is a page, where you should apply the rules above (composition, headings, layout, etc.).
- **Pages Router (Legacy)**  
  The `pages/` directory can still be used in existing projects. Keep the standard structure, and remember:
  - Business logic for SSR/SSG (getServerSideProps, getStaticProps) must remain in the `pages/` directory, as it won’t work elsewhere.

## Example Structure

<FileTree>
- src/
  - app/
    - posts/
      - page.tsx                  # Page component that composes feature widgets
  - features/
    - posts/
      - components/               # Posts-specific components
        - PostList.tsx            # Posts list component
      - hooks/                    # Posts-specific hooks
</FileTree>

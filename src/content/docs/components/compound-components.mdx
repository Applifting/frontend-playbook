## Why Compound Components?

The compound component pattern solves a common problem: **components that grow too many props**. Instead of passing numerous configuration options to a single component, you split functionality into smaller subcomponents that work together and share state implicitly.

**When to use it:**

- Components with multiple related parts (tabs, accordions, dropdowns, modals)
- When you need flexible composition — users can rearrange, omit, or extend subcomponents
- When a single component would require many props to configure all its parts

**Benefits:**

- **Reduced prop drilling** — state is shared implicitly via context
- **Flexible API** — consumers compose the UI declaratively by nesting children
- **Separation of concerns** — each subcomponent handles its own rendering logic

## Example

```tsx
// Usage
export const PopoverDemo = () => (
  <Popover>
    <Popover.Trigger asChild>
      <Button variant="outline">Open popover</Button>
    </Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Content className="w-80">
      <p>Content goes here</p>
    </Popover.Content>
  </Popover>
);
```

React doesn’t impose a strict structure for files. After experimenting with various approaches, we’ve found **Feature-sliced Design** to offer the best experience. This pattern is well-documented in the [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react) repository, and we should follow its structure. Instead of copying its contents here, please refer to their documentation, especially the [Project Structure](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md) section.

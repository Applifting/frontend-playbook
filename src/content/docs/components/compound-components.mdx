Compound components are a good React pattern because they **share state implicitly between a parent and its children**, removing the need to pass down lots of props. This makes the API **more flexible and declarative**, since consumers can compose the UI by nesting child components naturally. A big advantage is that you can **omit any child component you don't need**, keeping the usage **clean, intuitive, and scalable**.

```tsx
// Usage
export const PopoverDemo = () => (
  <Popover>
    <Popover.Trigger asChild>
      <Button variant="outline">Open popover</Button>
    </Popover.Trigger>
    <Popover.Content className="w-80">
      <p>Content goes here</p>
    </Popover.Content>
  </Popover>
);
```
